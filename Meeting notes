# Meeting notes by read.ai

10th of august 

In this meeting, Aastha Patel, Amit, and Mayank Rawat were discussing GitHub, focusing on its editing features and functionalities. Additionally, they talked about sending invitations and potential enhancements to their workflow. Aastha and Mayank also discussed sales and project collaborations, specifically mentioning their work with a GitHub repository and the importance of maintaining clean and efficient code.

A dispute arose between Amit and Aastha regarding the code and the repository. Aastha argued that large codebases often result in small outputs, while Amit attempted to explain that sometimes extensive code is necessary for complex functionalities. Mayank also participated in this debate, providing his insights into the matter.

Overall, the meeting covered various aspects of their project, including technical discussions about GitHub and broader topics such as sales and project management.

13th of august 

Amit is guiding everyone on how to push their code to the repository on GitHub effectively. He mentions that he consistently sees a green tick next to his commits because he regularly adds new changes to the repository. He suggests that if others are not seeing their commits, they should double-check their setup and make sure they're properly pushing their code.

Amit explains that to ensure the code is visible and properly integrated into the repository, they need to focus on a few steps:

1. **Repository Setup:** Make sure the repository is correctly set up, and the code is added to the right location.
2. **Commit and Push:** After making changes, commit those changes by adding a commit message, preferably with your name, and then push the code to the repository.
3. **Verification:** After pushing, check to see if the green tick appears next to your commit, indicating that the code has been successfully integrated.

If the code still isn’t showing up or reflecting changes, Amit offers to share his screen to demonstrate the process step-by-step. Additionally, he mentions another method where he could push everyone's code into a shared folder on GitHub. This way, everyone can access and integrate the code. He advises copying the code from the shared folder, pasting it into the appropriate location in their own repositories, and then pushing it again.

Also highlights that after following these steps, the code should be visible to the entire group, and each member will see the green tick indicating successful integration.

Amit:
"I want my name to show up. Look, my name should appear. If it doesn’t, just redo it, alright? What happens is, when you make a change and I make another with the name 'Amit,' it shows my name. For example, let's leave this as it is in Experiment 9. Just go ahead and make any small change, like adding a space or pressing Enter, and then commit the changes. Ensure your name is there."

Aastha Patel:
"Amit, since you created it, keep it as it is. Just remove your name from the code and let Pankaj add his. How can I remove it? Pankaj can add his name there. Also, Amit, you keep your name in the experiments. Seventh for Mayank, eighth for Vinit."

Amit:
"No, no, when you go to the profile, it should show the repositories. If not, it's alright. If necessary, I'll add the maximum file, that's it. Just make sure to check what code is inside and whether it is correct. If asked in class, we'll handle it then. Alright, let's proceed, everyone."
